### v1.3 - Advanced Features (Q1 2026)

**Focus:** Power user features and workflow enhancements

#### Planned Features

##### üîç Per-File Label Selection (Exploratory)
**Status:** Investigation Phase  
**Effort:** High (8-12 hours)  
**Description:** Apply different labels to different files in one operation

**Current Limitation:** All files get same label (mass labeling paradigm)

**Proposed Use Case:**
```
User has 10 files:
- 3 files ‚Üí "Confidential"
- 5 files ‚Üí "Internal"
- 2 files ‚Üí "Personal"

Currently requires 3 separate operations
Feature would allow one operation
```

**Design Challenges:**
1. Conflicts with "Mass Labeling" purpose
2. UI complexity (dropdown per file vs table view)
3. Smart Summary impact (redesign needed)

**Approaches Under Consideration:**
- **Table/Grid View** - DataGridView with dropdown per file
- **Two-Step Wizard** - Group files by label, then review
- **Smart Grouping** - Auto-group by current label, allow changes

**Phase 1 (v1.3):** Investigation only
- Research best practices
- Create UI mockups
- User feedback survey
- Document pros/cons

**Phase 2 (TBD):** Implementation (only if approved and design is intuitive)

##### üí° Undo Last Operation
**Status:** Planned  
**Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours)  
**Description:** Revert last label application
- Store previous state after application
- "Angre siste merking" button
- Reapply original labels
- Limit to last operation only (not full history)

**Use Case:** User accidentally applied wrong label to 100 files

##### üí° Label Statistics / Report
**Status:** Planned  
**Effort:** Medium (3-5 hours)  
**Description:** Show statistics about current file selection
- Current label distribution:
  ```
  Confidential: 15 files (45%)
  Internal: 10 files (30%)
  No label: 8 files (25%)
  
  Total: 33 files
  ```
- Optional pie chart or bar chart visualization
- Export to CSV

**Use Case:** Auditing and compliance reporting

##### üí° Label Templates / Presets
**Status:** Planned  
**Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours)  
**Description:** Save common label configurations as templates
- "Contracts Template" ‚Üí Auto-select "Confidential"
- "Memos Template" ‚Üí Auto-select "Internal"
- Save/load from config file
- Quick access via Templates dropdown

**Use Case:** Frequently label specific types of documents with specific labels

**Priority:** Low

**Description:** Dark color theme option
- Theme toggle in Settings
- Dark color palette definition
- Apply to all controls
- Save preference in `app_config.json`

**Rationale:** Modern UX trend, easier on eyes in low-light environments

##### üí° Multi-Language Support

## Feature Evaluation Criteria

New features are evaluated based on:

1. **User Value**: How much does it improve user experience?
2. **Complexity**: How difficult is implementation?
3. **Alignment**: Does it fit the "mass labeling" purpose?
4. **Maintenance**: What's the long-term maintenance cost?
5. **UI Impact**: Does it complicate the interface?

### Design Philosophy

FileLabeler is a **mass labeling tool** - designed for bulk operations, not file-by-file management.

**New features should:**
- ‚úÖ Maintain simplicity and ease of use
- ‚úÖ Not conflict with "bulk" paradigm
- ‚úÖ Add clear value for typical use cases
- ‚úÖ Not overcomplicate the UI

**Avoid features that:**
- ‚ùå Turn it into a general file manager
- ‚ùå Duplicate existing tools (e.g., Windows Explorer)
- ‚ùå Add complexity without proportional value
- ‚ùå Require significant UI redesign

## Tentative Release Schedule

| Version | Focus | Target |
|---------|-------|--------|
| v1.2 | Code Quality & Quick Wins | Q4 2025 |
| v1.3 | Advanced Features | Q1 2026 |
| v2.0 | Modernization | Q2-Q3 2026 |

**Note:** Schedule is tentative and may adjust based on:
- User feedback and priorities
- Development capacity
- Technical challenges
- Security updates or critical fixes

---

## Declined Features

Features we've considered but decided against:

### Email Integration
**Reason:** Out of scope. FileLabeler focuses on labeling, not distribution.

### Office Add-in
**Reason:** Microsoft Purview client already provides this. FileLabeler's value is in bulk operations.

### Label Policy Management
**Reason:** This is an admin function. FileLabeler is for end-users applying labels to files.

### File Content Search
**Reason:** This turns FileLabeler into a file manager. Use Windows Search or other tools.
